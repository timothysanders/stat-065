Frequency tables are also known as frequency distributions because they allow you to understand the distribution of values in your dataset.\n","\n","For example, if 18 students have pet dogs, dog ownership has a frequency of 18.

Essentially, it is a way to generate a table that shows the frequency with which certain groups of data appear together. The `crosstab` function is often used in statistics and data analysis to analyze the relationship between two or more variables.\n","\n","Here's a basic overview of its functionality:\n","\n","1. **Syntax**: The basic syntax of `pandas.crosstab` is:\n","   ```python\n","   pandas.crosstab(index, columns, values=None, rownames=None, colnames=None, aggfunc=None, margins=False, margins_name='All', ...)\n","   ```\n","\n","   - `index`: Array-like, values to group by in the rows.\n","   - `columns`: Array-like, values to group by in the columns.\n","   - `values`: Array-like, optional, array to aggregate according to the factors.\n","   - `aggfunc`: Function, optional, if provided, requires `values` to be specified as well. It applies the function to the values for aggregation.\n","   - `margins`: Boolean, default False, add row/column margins (subtotals).\n","   - `margins_name`: Name of the row/column that will contain the totals when `margins` is True.\n","\n","2. **Use Cases**: `crosstab` is commonly used for:\n","   - Exploring data to understand the relationship between two categorical variables.\n","   - Summarizing the data to prepare it for further analysis or to present insights from the data.\n","   - Conducting contingency analysis in statistics.\n","\n","3. **Example**:\n","   Suppose you have a DataFrame `df` with columns `'Gender'` and `'Handedness'`, you can use `crosstab` to understand the distribution as follows:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   import pandas as pd\n","\n","   # Sample DataFrame\n","   df = pd.DataFrame({\n","       'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male'],\n","       'Handedness': ['Right-handed', 'Left-handed', 'Right-handed', 'Right-handed', 'Left-handed']\n","   })\n","\n","   # Crosstab\n","   ctab = pd.crosstab(df['Gender'], df['Handedness'])\n","   print(ctab)\n","   ```\n","\n","   This will produce a table that shows the count of males and females for each handedness category.\n","\n","`pandas.crosstab` is a highly versatile function that can be customized in various ways to suit different requirements of data analysis, making it a valuable tool for understanding and presenting categorical data relationships.\n","</details>\n","\n","##Syntax:\n","###`pandas.crosstab(index, columns, values=None, rownames=None, colnames=None, aggfunc=None, margins=False, margins_name: str = 'All', dropna: bool = True, normalize=False)`\n","\n","\n","<details>\n","  <summary><b>Show Description of crosstab parameters</b></summary>\n","Let’s

Essentially, it is a way to generate a table that shows the frequency with which certain groups of data appear together. The `crosstab` function is often used in statistics and data analysis to analyze the relationship between two or more variables.\n","\n","Here's a basic overview of its functionality:\n","\n","1. **Syntax**: The basic syntax of `pandas.crosstab` is:\n","   ```python\n","   pandas.crosstab(index, columns, values=None, rownames=None, colnames=None, aggfunc=None, margins=False, margins_name='All', ...)\n","   ```\n","\n","   - `index`: Array-like, values to group by in the rows.\n","   - `columns`: Array-like, values to group by in the columns.\n","   - `values`: Array-like, optional, array to aggregate according to the factors.\n","   - `aggfunc`: Function, optional, if provided, requires `values` to be specified as well. It applies the function to the values for aggregation.\n","   - `margins`: Boolean, default False, add row/column margins (subtotals).\n","   - `margins_name`: Name of the row/column that will contain the totals when `margins` is True.\n","\n","2. **Use Cases**: `crosstab` is commonly used for:\n","   - Exploring data to understand the relationship between two categorical variables.\n","   - Summarizing the data to prepare it for further analysis or to present insights from the data.\n","   - Conducting contingency analysis in statistics.\n","\n","3. **Example**:\n","   Suppose you have a DataFrame `df` with columns `'Gender'` and `'Handedness'`, you can use `crosstab` to understand the distribution as follows:\n","\n","   ```python\n","   import pandas as pd\n","\n","   # Sample DataFrame\n","   df = pd.DataFrame({\n","       'Gender': ['Male', 'Female', 'Female', 'Male', 'Male'],\n","       'Handedness': ['Right-handed', 'Left-handed', 'Right-handed', 'Right-handed', 'Left-handed']\n","   })\n","\n","   # Crosstab\n","   ctab = pd.crosstab(df['Gender'], df['Handedness'])\n","   print(ctab)\n","   ```\n","\n","   This will produce a table that shows the count of males and females for each handedness category.\n","\n","`pandas.crosstab` is a highly versatile function that can be customized in various ways to suit different requirements of data analysis, making it a valuable tool for understanding and presenting categorical data relationships.\n","</details>\n","\n","##Syntax:\n","###`pandas.crosstab(index, columns, values=None, rownames=None, colnames=None, aggfunc=None, margins=False, margins_name: str = 'All', dropna: bool = True, normalize=False)`\n","\n","\n","<details>\n","  <summary><b>Show Description of crosstab parameters</b></summary>\n","Let’s take a closer look at these parameters:\n","\n","|Parameter\t|Default Value\t|Description|\n","|:--:|:--:|:--:|\n","|index\t|\t|Values to group by in rows\n","|columns|\t|\tValues to group by in columns\n","|values\t|\t|Array of values to aggregate\n","|rownames|\t|\tWhat to name rows (list)\n","|colnames\t||\tWhat to name columns (list)\n","|aggfunc\t|count\t|How to aggregate data\n","|margins\t|False\t|Add row/column totals\n","|margins_name\t|“All”\t|The name for row/column totals\n","|dropna\t|True\t|Do not include columns whose entries are all NaN\n","|normalize\t|False\t|Normalize by dividing all values by the sum of values.<br> Learn more in the section of normalizing.\n","\n","</details>"],"metadata":{"id":"x2JecJWj9ioo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **A.
