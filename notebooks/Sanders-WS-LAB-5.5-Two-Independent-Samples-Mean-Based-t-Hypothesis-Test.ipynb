Here are the key requirements:\n","\n","<details>\n","  <summary><b>Assumptions</b></summary>\n","\n","1. **Independent Samples**: The samples being compared must be independent of each other. This means that the observations in one sample are not influenced by or related to the observations in the other sample. Independence is often assumed when samples are randomly selected or when one sample's measurements do not affect the other sample.\n","\n","2. **Normality or Sufficiently Large Sample Sizes**: The distribution of the populations from which the samples are drawn should ideally be normal. However, if the sample sizes are large (typically considered as n ≥ 30), the Central Limit Theorem suggests that the sampling distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal regardless of the population distribution. For smaller sample sizes, the populations should still be reasonably symmetric or unimodal to ensure accurate hypothesis testing.\n","\n","3. **Homogeneity (Equality) of Variances**: Certain hypothesis tests, such as the independent samples t-test, assume that the variances of the populations from which the samples are drawn are equal. This assumption can be checked using statistical tests like Levene's test for homogeneity of variances. If the assumption of equal variances is violated, alternative tests such as Welch's t-test, which does not assume equal variances, can be used.\n","\n","4. **Random Sampling**: Samples should be drawn randomly from their respective populations to ensure that they are representative of those populations. Random sampling helps reduce the risk of bias and ensures that the results are generalizable to the larger population from which the samples were drawn.\n","\n","5. **Measurement Scale**: The data should be measured on an interval or ratio scale. This ensures that meaningful arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can be performed on the data, facilitating accurate statistical analysis.\n","\n","By ensuring these requirements are met, researchers can conduct hypothesis tests of the mean involving two samples with greater confidence, leading to more reliable conclusions about differences or relationships between populations.\n","\n","\n","</details>"],"metadata":{"id":"DlxikoXT9ejo"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### **Checking the Normality of Data with Python**\n","\n","The **Shapiro-Wilk test** is a statistical test used to **assess the normality** of a dataset.
